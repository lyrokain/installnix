This is going to be an install script to automatically install a copy of NixOS. You will need to boot a machine using an ISO-Image of NixOS for this to work. 

It will of corse repartition and format the disk of that machine. Make sure it does not contain any data you might need again.

Remember to set your root and user passwords in the lower portion of the script.
